            And, when designing a website, some colors can be trickier than others. Unlike the heavy hitters — your reds, blues, greens — orange is tougher to figure out. For many, orange implies fun or relaxation. For others, it’s a basketball, a “Road Work Ahead” sign, or the eponymous fruit that, as it turns out, makes decent juice.

              Orange also proves useful in a practical sense, especially for drawing the eye to a part of the page. This makes it a great color for CTAs. It’s bright, but doesn’t have the same “stop” or “slow down” implications as red and yellow.

            <div class="pt-4 gre">
              All in all, choosing to put orange at the front of your <span class="para">brand’s color scheme</span> is a bold and respectable choice (if you hadn’t already noticed, orange is an important color to us too). However, it does present a challenge for your <span class="para">website’s design</span>, especially if it’s your first time crafting a website.

What we like: We use orange throughout our website for primary CTAs and, of course, our sprocket logo. It’s also common in our software interface for interactive items like buttons, as well as data visualizations. You can learn more about how HubSpot uses color, fonts, photos, and more in our style guide.

What we like: Wild Souls went above and beyond with just about every aspect of its website, leveraging rich, earthy colors to complement its offerings of unprocessed, plant-based foods. From scrolling and cursor effects to detailed photos to carefully chosen fonts and copy, browsing this site is almost as immersive as sampling the halva yourself.

What we like: The Milkshake app lets you create a free and simple personal website to be linked in your social media bio. Milkshake’s own website employs softer shades of orange to accentuate the sparse pages and hold the visitor’s attention. We especially enjoy the colors the designers chose for text, opting for a brighter orange that contrast well enough with its background.

What we like: When it comes to lists like this, design agencies have an almost unfair advantage. They’re design agencies, after all. Humbleteam is one such group that uses its trademark shade of orange liberally to tie its diverse illustrations together.

What we like: Syracuse University in New York is recognized for its orange iconography — it’s sports teams are even called the “Orange.” You can expect the color to work itself into the school’s main website in several spots. To stay readable and conform to what users expect from an academic website, however, the designers refrained from going overboard and instead use Orange sparingly, but effectively.

What we like: The website of AI consulting group Humain features a brilliant cursor effect. As you move your mouse, your cursor acts like an orange spotlight that reveals bits of hidden text on the page. In particular, we enjoy how its navigation menu works — instead of clicking the hamburger button on the top right to reveal its items, just hover your mouse over to expose them.

What we like: I don’t know what it is about beverage websites specifically, but they seem to know what makes websites work. Tropical Moscato is one shining example — the scrolling experience is a wonderful barrage of different flavors, each more tempting than the last.

What we like: Here’s another university website that harnesses its orange branding with great results. The color is utilized to draw attention toward important areas of focus, namely stats, quotes, CTAs, and navigational links. The animated vector art toward the bottom of the homepage is a nice touch as well.

What we like: You wanted orange websites, didn’t you? Bad jokes aside, Florida’s Natural orange juice serves a surprisingly fresh website with interesting and creative effects. Particularly clever is the way the orange sticks to the center of the window as you scroll, telling the story of how it reaches your glass.
